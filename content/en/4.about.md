A few words about me

#intro
Originally a New Yorker, I live in Flagstaff, AZ nowadays. Along with my partner, cat and dog, I love living out here, where the crisp mountain air, cinnamon-y pine trees and occasional jaunt down to the Superstition Wilderness, Grand Canyon, or Sedona keep us grounded in plenty of nature experiences.

I'm a software engineer by training, with over a decade of experience working at startups and big tech behemoths alike. While I love writing code and building products with my own two hands, I am equally passionate about leadership and coaching, and I've been managing software development teams for the past 6 years.

I've recently taken the plunge into entrepreneurship, and I'm currently building out several projects; some with friends, and others solo. You can see a portfolio of my projects here on this site.

You'll find all the details of my employment history and professional experience, along with glowing reviews from my peers, managers and employees over [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-ventresca-94227019/) on LinkedIn.
